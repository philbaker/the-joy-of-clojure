;; Concurrency
;; Refers to the execution of disparate tasks at roughly the same time,
;; each sharing a common resource, but not necessarily performing
;; related tasks.
;; The results of concurrent tasks often affect the behaviour of other
;; concurrent tasks and therefore contains an element of nondeterminism

;; Parallelism
;; Refers to partitioning a task into multiple parts, each run at the
;; same time.
;; Typically, parallel tasks work toward an aggregate goal, and the
;; result of one doesn't affect the behaviour of any other parallel
;; task, thus maintaining determinacy.
